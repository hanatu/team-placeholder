# Introduction to the project
Our project is about how important life history traits affect diversification rates of mammals. The goal of the project to use statistical methods to test these effects and to see if there are any interactions between life history traits in regards to their effect on diversification. This could provide insight into evolutionary processes and how they can differ between mammal groups.

# Description of the data
This data set is about characteristics that are related to life history for a variety of mammalian species. We will probably use variables such as Gestation time in months, Maximum life span in months, adult body mass in grams, and litters per year to investigate the relationship and interractions of these important traits. The data set we will use was a meta-analysis of previous literature and data sources which are documented for each species.

# Team description
Biography of team members:

- Daire Crawford: Good with correlations and plotting, comfortable with figure captions and technical terms 
- Kyra Fine: Good with analysis pipelines and communicative writing (e.g. explaining the results and discussion) 
- Ruxin Liu: Good with Statistics, having some background knowledge anot statistics and enjoy programing in R 
- Hanatu Tak: Willing to take the leftovers and is comfortable with everything, editing and detail oriented

Team roles: First Meeting- Daire: Recorder (1) Kyra: Organizer (2) Hanatu and Ruxin: Facilitators (3,4)

Positions will be rotated numerically (i.e. position 1, recorder, will move to position 2, organizer, for the next meeting. Position 3 will become position 4, and 4 will cycle back to position 1, etc.).
